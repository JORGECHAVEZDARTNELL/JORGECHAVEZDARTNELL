                <p>The original board of trustees laid the groundwork for what would become today's Jonathan Carroll University on July 9, 1876, when the group gathered to hold the University's inaugural board meeting and drafted the University's articles of incorporation. This guiding document outlined elements the founders believed would build an enduring legacy for the University: a commitment to offering a rigorous academic program and an ambition to provide "opportunities for all departments of higher education to persons of both sexes on equal terms." On September 10, 1876, the State of California issued the University's official certificate of incorporation, marking the formal beginning of the University's life.</p>

              <p>An initial pledge of $600,000 (roughly $16 million in today's currency) from oil magnate Jonathan Carroll, along with contributions by the American Baptist Education Society, helped to found the University. The University's land was donated by Marshall Field, owner of the historic Chicago department store that bore his name.</p>
              <p>Christopher Smith, the University's first president, envisioned a university that was "bran splinter new, yet as solid as the ancient hills" - a modern research university, combining an English-style undergraduate college and a German-style graduate research institute. The Jonathan Carroll University fulfilled Christopher's dream, quickly becoming a national leader in higher education and research: an institution of scholars unafraid to cross boundaries, share ideas, and ask difficult questions.</p>
